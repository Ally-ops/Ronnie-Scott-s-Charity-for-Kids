Ronnie Scott's Kids' Charity

UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and 
how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

Ronnie Scott's is a Jazz Club in Soho, London. The club also operates a non-profit organisation (Ronnie Scott's Kids' Charity) 
which focuses on raising funds for their goals, and is dedicated to ensuring that the next generation of jazz musicians, 
regardless of their demographics, have access to the finest music eduction, around the UK, and abroad.

I attended the Ronnis Scott's 60th Anniversary fundraising event at the Royal Albert Hall in October 2019. In addition to professional artists,
there were also a large number of kids performing, as a parent of a child dedicated to performing, I was impressed by the enthusiasm of all 
the young people performing. It reminded me of the immense amount of time and effort parents/carers, and young people dedicate to performing.  
I wanted to design a website that was dedicated to providing valuable information for young people, and parents/carers to give them access 
to a wealth of choices within music.


As a parent, I want to find out what is expected of my child so that I can discuss what the charity will expect from us.

As a kid, I want to see videos or images of kids my age playing music so that I can see what a real-life experience is like.

As admin, I want to be able to have contact details for parents/carers so that I can contact them with classes in their area.

As a parent, I want to find out what times/days music classes are run so that I can work out if this fits in with the rest of 
the family commitments.

As a kid, I want to see videos or testimonial of kids my age so that I know how they felt when they first joined a class.

As admin, I want kids and parents/carers to share information about our charity so that we raise awareness of our fundraising.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

Surface  -  The color scheme of green, purple, and gold was chosen as they are warm welcoming colors that may help to evoke emotion, 
            and imagination in the kids, and parents visiting the site.

Skeleton  - Wireframes define the placement layout of Home, Kids, Parents, and Contact pages.

Structure - The Home page provides links to the navigation bar, signposting parents and kids to their individual pages which lead them 
            to contact details, personal information input, and videos/links to classes held across the UK.
          - Parents use their page to find out about their, and their childs ode of conduct, and locations, and times of classes.
          - the kids page uses videos to show real-life experiences, and provides classes and locations.
          - The contact page gives admin information on both parents and the kids so they can signpost them in the right direction.

Scope     - Features and functions
          - Existing features; this site uses Bootstrap4 navigational bar, grid system and contact form.
            The contact form allows parents to register their details with the chairty so they can receive the information they need.
          - Features left to implement; Notification of upcoming events to parents and kids to increase traffic to the site.
          - Future features; Link to the charity fundraising site to increase traffic to this site, and raise awareness, and fundraising.
Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea

Strategy = User stories


Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
