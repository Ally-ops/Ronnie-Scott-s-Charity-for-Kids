# Ronnie Scott's Kids' Charity 

## UX  

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things. In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure: 

Ronnie Scott's is a Jazz Club in Soho, London. The club also operates a non-profit organisation (Ronnie Scott's Kids' Charity) which focuses on raising funds for their goals, and is dedicated to ensuring that the next generation of jazz musicians, regardless of their demographics, have access to the finest music education, in the UK, and abroad. 

I attended the Ronnie Scott's 60th Anniversary fundraising event at the Royal Albert Hall in October 2019. In addition to professional artists, there was also a large number of kids performing, and as a parent of a child dedicated to performing, I was impressed by the enthusiasm of all the young people performing. It reminded me of the immense amount of time and effort parents/carers, and young people dedicate to performing. 
I wanted to design a website that was dedicated to providing valuable information for young people, and parents/carers to give them access to a wealth of choices within the jazz music industry. 

 

## User Stories UX  

As a parent, I want to find out what is expected of my child so that I can chat with him about what the charity’s expectations are when he is attending classes, or performing.  

As a kid, I want to see videos or images of kids my age playing music so that I can see what a real-life experience is like. 

As admin, I want to be able to have contact details for parents/carers so that I can contact them with classes and events in their area. 

As a parent, I want to find out what times/days music classes are run so that I can work out if this fits in with the rest of my family’s commitments. 

As a kid, I want to see videos or testimonial of kids my age so that I know how they felt when they first joined a class. 

As admin, I want kids and parents/carers to share information about our charity so that we raise awareness of our fundraising.

## Deployment

I used the following link to deploy my project to Github pages: https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site

A link to my website can be found here: http ................

Home page; all of the links in the navbar work, and the media player functions.
Kids page; all of the links in the navbar work, and the media player functions. All of the links to the external websites work.
Parents page; all of the links in the navbar work, and the media player functions. All of the links to the external websites work.
Contact page; Fields in contact form can be filled out but the 'Submit form' button does not work as I have not learnt this yet. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.



## Testing 

The HTML code for all four pages was put through the HTML Validator to check for errors. 
The CSS code was put through the CSS Validator to check for errors. 

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:


In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
